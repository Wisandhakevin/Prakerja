READ and SAVE "radius"
COMPUTE "circumference" as 2 multiplied by 3.14 multiplied by "radius"
COMPUTE "area" as 3.14 multiplied by "radius" multiplied by "radius"
SHOW "circumference" as the computed circumference of the circle
SHOW "area" as the computed area of the circle

===================================================
EXAMPLE :
READ and SAVE "radius" as 5
COMPUTE "circumference" as 2 multiplied by 3.14 multiplied by 5
COMPUTE "area" as 3.14 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5
SHOW "circumference" as 31.4 units (computed circumference of the circle)
SHOW "area" as 78.5 square units (computed area of the circle)
